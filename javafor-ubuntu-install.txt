# this document for java install in ubuntu and debian flavaour OS
which java      --> to check java installd or not
if the command gives output then java installed otherwise java is not installed
which javac     --> to check jabac installed or not

Java are two types 1. openjdk 2. oracle java

java versions are called as java 6, java7 ,java8 ,java9 like that.

latest java8 is mostly all developers are using
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk -y      --> to install java6 of openjdk
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk -y      --> to  install java7 of openjdk 
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk -y      --> install java8 of openjdk

Orcalce java install command are 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt install oracle-java8-installer -y    --> then oracle java is installed

Now java is installed.
Now we have to identify path of java installed, here "path" means "directory of where java installation files are downlaoded"

for that type as which java  -->then it will give output as  /usr/bin/java/bin/java
Note: /bin/java is short path of java installed directory.
      To set Envirornmental variable we require full path.
To identify full path then command is "   readlink -f /usr/bin/java
note: It will give output like /usr/lib/jvm/openjdk some thing  --> this oupt may change for installation to installation 
   

Now setting environmental variable for all users. we can set env for one user also.
Here I am discussing setting environmental variable for all users.

to set envormental are two types.the below contentt is smae for bpoth redhat,centos, ubuntud and debian any veriosn of operating systems.
/etc/profile  --> /profile it is a file
/etc/prfoile.d   --> /profile.d is a directory

Note: use any one of the method only.

First I am discusing here /etc/profile

/profile is a file 


use any one , I am telling here /profile only

vi /etc/profile
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/        (note: /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/ --> is readlink -f bin/java output)
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin

save and exit

Note: /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.201-2.6.16.1.el7_6.x86_64/   ---> this is readlink -f /bin/java oupput.

source /etc/profile  --> to recongnise setting env

note : Do not use like  "  sudo source /etc/profile

Finally to check java is installed or not then Type as "    echo $JAVA_HOME 
it will give the output

finally we innstalled java and set environmenatl varibale to all users.


Second method  for seting envorinmentl varible
 go to /etc/profile.d

we have create file java-env.sh and in that file content is like
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.201-2.6.16.1.el7_6.x86_64/        
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin

Note: java-env.sh   : java-env is not necessary , it can be any name but file extenstion must be any .sh

Note: the files in /etc/profile.d are readable to all user in that linux system. 

finally source /etc/profile

to check Java env is setted or not command is echo $JAVA_HOME
